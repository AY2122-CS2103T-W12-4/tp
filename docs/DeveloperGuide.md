### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/modulink/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/modulink/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `addFav A0123456A`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/modulink/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/modulink/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ModuLinkParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `CreateCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("addFav")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `addFav` Command](images/AddFavSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ModuLinkParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `CreateCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `CreateCommand`) which the `ModuLinkParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `CreateCommandParser`, `EditCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/modulink/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ModuLink`, which `Person` references. This allows `ModuLink` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/modulink/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ModuLinkStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.modulink.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Create A Profile
#### Implementation
The `create` mechanism will allow the user to create a personal profile.

The implementation required the creation of a parser for `CreateCommand` as the command does takes in parameters (personal information, module information etc..).
`CreateCommand` class updates the `Model` class and then returns a new instance of the `CommandResult` class.
The GUI will then update to include the created profile and the current user's profile will be highlighted in the GUI.
After creating a profile, the user can now use other commands in ModuLink.

#### Usage
To use this function and create a profile, simply enter the command and the required parameters in the command line in the following format.
`create n/NAME id/STUDENT_ID p/PHONE e/EMAIL [mod/TAG]...` <br/>
Example: `create n/John Doe id/A1234567Z p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com mod/CS2100 mod/CS2101`

The following sequence diagram shows how the `create` mechanism works:
![CreateSequenceDiagram](images/CreateSequenceDiagram.png)


### Add A Module Tag
#### Implementation
The `addMod` mechanism will allow the user to add a module tag to their profile.

The implementation required the creation of a parser for `addModCommand` as the command does takes in parameters.
`addModCommand` class updates the `Model` class and then returns a new instance of the `CommandResult` class.
The GUI will then update to include the tags for the user profile.

#### Usage
To use this function and create a profile, simply enter the command and the required parameters in the command line in the following format.
`addMod [mod/MOD]...` <br/>
Example: `addMod mod/CS2103T`

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addMod` mechanism works:
![AddModSequenceDiagram](images/AddModSequenceDiagram.png)


### Add A Profile As Favourite
#### Implementation
The `addFav` mechanism will allow the user to add a module tag to their profile.

The implementation required the creation of a parser for `addFavCommand` as the command does takes in parameters.
`addFavCommand` class updates the `Model` class and then returns a new instance of the `CommandResult` class.
The GUI will then update to show the specified profile as a favourite.

#### Usage
To use this function and create a profile, simply enter the command and the required parameters in the command line in the following format.
`addFav Student_ID` <br/>
Example: `addFav A1234567X`

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addFav` mechanism works:
![AddFavSequenceDiagram](images/AddFavSequenceDiagram.png)


### List All Favourited Profiles
#### Implementation
The `listFav` mechanism will allow the user to view all the students that he/she has favourited.

The implementation did not require the creation of a parser for `ListFavCommand` as the command does not take in any parameters.
`ListFavCommand` class updates the `Model` class and then returns a new instance of the `CommandResult` class.
The GUI will then change the content to display all favourited profiles. 

#### Usage
To use this function to see all favourited profiles, simply enter `listFav` in the command line. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the `listFav` mechanism works:
![ListFavSequenceDiagram](images/ListFavSequenceDiagram.png)


### Filter Profiles By Name
#### Implementation
The `find` mechanism will allow the user to filter profiles by name.

The implementation required the creation of a parser for `findCommand` as the command does takes in parameters.
`findCommand` class updates the `Model` class and then returns a new instance of the `CommandResult` class.
The GUI will then update to show the profiles that contain the specified name.

#### Usage
To use this function and create a profile, simply enter the command and the required parameters in the command line in the following format.
`find NAME` <br/>
Example: `find Charlotte`

The following sequence diagram shows how the `find` mechanism works:
![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedModuLink`. It extends `ModuLink` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `moduLinkStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedModuLink#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedModuLink#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedModuLink#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitModuLink()`, `Model#undoModuLink()` and `Model#redoModuLink()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedModuLink` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitModuLink()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `moduLinkStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitModuLink()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `moduLinkStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitModuLink()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `moduLinkStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoModuLink()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial ModuLink state, then there are no previous ModuLink states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoModuLink()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoModuLink()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `moduLinkStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone ModuLink states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoModuLink()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitModuLink()`, `Model#undoModuLink()` or `Model#redoModuLink()`. Thus, the `moduLinkStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitModuLink()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `moduLinkStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
